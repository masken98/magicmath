This is a repo where I put some code for MTG stuff I find interesting

## TournamentSim.py
A simulator for a tournament. It simulates a single tournament with the decks and winrates in the list att the top, or another that you pass to it.

### Usage
The matrix at the top contains all information needed to simulate the tournament. Each row is one archetype and is on the form (deck name, its winrates in all matchups, number of players who played the deck). If the matrix is sorted as a winrate matrix each row in the winrate matrix would correspond to the decks winrates.
